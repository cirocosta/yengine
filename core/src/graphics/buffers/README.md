# Buffers

## OpenGL Context

We can think of contexts as a storage of all of the state associated with a given instance of OpenGL, as well as separate viewable surface which has OpenGL commands (which only works inside the current context).

## OpenGL Objects and Buffer Objects


## VBO

> VBO is a **Buffer Object**

Both *Buffer* and *IndexBuffer* are VBOs, each of it being specialized for a certain kind of target to build the buffeer to.

## VAO

> VAO is an **OpenGL Object**
